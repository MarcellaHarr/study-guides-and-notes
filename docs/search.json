    "text": "Characteristics of Algorithms\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNames\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiniteness\nAn algorithm must always have a finite number of steps before it ends. When the operation is finished, it must have a defined endpoint or output and not enter an endless loop.\nDefiniteness\nAn algorithm needs to have exact definitions for each step. Clear and straightforward directions ensure that every step is understood and can be taken easily.\nInput\nAn algorithm requires one or more inputs. The values that are first supplied to the algorithm before its processing are known as inputs. These inputs come from a predetermined range of acceptable values.\nOutput\nOne or more outputs must be produced by an algorithm. The output is the outcome of the algorithm after every step has been completed. The relationship between the input and the result should be clear.\nEffectiveness\nAn algorithm’s stages must be sufficiently straightforward to be carried out in a finite time utilizing fundamental operations. With the resources at hand, every operation in the algorithm should be doable and practicable.\nGenerality\nRather than being limited to a single particular case, an algorithm should be able to solve a group of issues. It should offer a generic fix that manages a variety of inputs inside a predetermined range or domain.\n\n\n\n\n\nFactors of an Algorithm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Modularity**\nThis feature was perfectly designed for the algorithm if you are given a problem and break it down into small-small modules or small-small steps, which is a basic definition of an algorithm.\nCorrectness\nAn algorithm’s correctness is defined as when the given inputs produce the desired output, indicating that the algorithm was designed correctly. An algorithm’s analysis has been completed correctly.\nMaintainability\nIt means that the algorithm should be designed in a straightforward, structured way so that when you redefine the algorithm, no significant changes are made to the algorithm.\nFunctionality\nIt takes into account various logical steps to solve a real-world problem.\nRobustness\nRobustness refers to an algorithm’s ability to define your problem clearly.\nUser-friendly\nIf the algorithm is difficult to understand, the designer will not explain it to the programmer.\nSimplicity\nIf an algorithm is simple, it is simple to understand.\n**Extensibility**\nYour algorithm should be extensible if another algorithm designer or programmer wants to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Algorithms\n\n\nType-1Type-2Type-3Type-4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrute Force Algorithm\nA straightforward approach that exhaustively tries all possible solutions, suitable for small problem instances but may become impractical for larger ones due to its high time complexity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecursive Algorithm\nA method that breaks a problem into smaller, similar subproblems and repeatedly applies itself to solve them until reaching a base case, making it effective for tasks with recursive structures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEncryption Algorithm\nUtilized to transform data into a secure, unreadable form using cryptographic techniques, ensuring confidentiality and privacy in digital communications and transactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBacktracking Algorithm\nA trial-and-error technique used to explore potential solutions by undoing choices when they lead to an incorrect outcome, commonly employed in puzzles and optimization problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearching Algorithm\nDesigned to find a specific target within a data set, enabling efficient retrieval of information from sorted or unsorted collections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSorting Algorithm\nAimed at arranging elements in a specific order, like numerical or alphabetical, to enhance data organization and retrieval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHashing Algorithm\nConverts data into a fixed-size hash value, enabling rapid data access and retrieval in hash tables, commonly used in databases and password storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDivide & Conquer Algorithm\nBreaks a complex problem into smaller subproblems, solves them independently, and then combines their solutions to address the original problem effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreedy Algorithm\nMakes locally optimal choices at each step in the hope of finding a global optimum, useful for optimization problems but may not always lead to the best solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Programming Algorithm\nStores and reuses intermediate results to avoid redundant computations, enhancing the efficiency of solving complex problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandomized Algorithm\nUtilizes randomness in its steps to achieve a solution, often used in situations where an approximate or probabilistic answer suffices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecursive Algorithms\n\n\nAlgorithms\nRecursive algorithms are a fundamental concept in computer science, particularly in the study of data structures and algorithms. A recursive algorithm is one that solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller instances of the same problem, which it then solves in the same way. This process continues until the problem is reduced to a base case, which is solved directly without further recursion.\n\n\n\nKey Concepts\n\n\nBase CaseRecursive CaseStack\n\n\nThis is the condition under which the recursion stops. It represents the simplest instance of the problem, which can be solved directly without further recursion.\n\n\nThis is the part of the algorithm that breaks the problem down into smaller instances of the same problem and then calls the algorithm recursively on these smaller instances.\n\n\nEach recursive call is placed on the system call stack. When the base case is reached, the stack begins to unwind as each instance of the function returns its result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactorial Calculation\n\nThe factorial of a number n (denoted as n!) is a classic example of a recursive algorithm. The factorial is defined as:\n\nO! = 1 (Base Case)\nN! = n * (n-1)! For n &gt; O (Recursive Case)\n\n\nCodeLogicPros/ConsUsage\n\n\n\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:  # Base Case\n        return 1\n    else:  # Recursive Case\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\n\n\nHow It Works:\n\nBase Case: When n is 0, the function returns 1.\nRecursive Case: For any other value of n, the function calls itself with n−1 and multiplies the result by n.\n\nFor example, calling factorial(3) would work as follows:\n\nfactorial(3) calls factorial(2)\nfactorial(2) calls factorial(1)\nfactorial(1) calls factorial(0)\nfactorial(0) returns 1, then:\nfactorial(1) returns 1 * 1 = 1\nfactorial(2) returns 2 * 1 = 2\nfactorial(3) returns 3 * 2 = 6\n\n\n\nAdvantages of Recursion\n\nSimplicity: Recursive solutions are often more elegant and easier to understand than their iterative counterparts.\nDirect Translation: Some problems are naturally recursive, like tree traversals, making recursion the most straightforward approach.\n\nDisadvantages of Recursion\n\nPerformance: Recursive algorithms can be less efficient due to the overhead of multiple function calls and potential stack overflow issues for deep recursion.\nMemory Usage: Recursion can consume more memory because each function call adds a new frame to the call stack.\n\n\n\nWhen to Use Recursion - When a problem can naturally be divided into similar sub-problems (e.g., tree traversal, searching algorithms like binary search). - When the recursive solution is significantly simpler or more intuitive than an iterative one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear & Binary Search\n\nLinear search and binary search are two fundamental algorithms used to search for an element in a collection, like an array or a list. However, they differ significantly in how they approach the search and their efficiency.\n\n\nLinear Search\n\n\nConceptStepsUsage\n\n\n\nLinear search is the simplest search algorithm.\nIt works by sequentially checking each element of the array or list until the target element is found or the end of the collection is reached.\n\n\n\nAlgorithm:\n\nStart from the first element of the array.\nCompare the current element with the target element.\nIf they match, return the index of the element.\nIf they don’t match, move to the next element and repeat the process.\nIf the target element is not found by the end of the array, return a “not found” indication.\n\nTime Complexity: \\(O(n)\\), where n is the number of elements in the array.

It’s a way to describe the efficiency of an algorithm as the input size grows towards infinity.\n\nWhy Use Big O Notation?\n\nComparing Algorithms: It allows us to compare the efficiency of different algorithms independently of hardware or other environmental factors.\nScalability: It helps us understand how an algorithm will perform as the size of the input data grows.\n\n\n\nO Notations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Big Os\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO(1) - Constant Time:\n\nDescription: The algorithm takes the same amount of time to execute regardless of the size of the input.\nExample: Accessing an element in an array by index.\nEfficiency: Excellent.\n\nO(log n) - Logarithmic Time:\n\nDescription: The runtime increases logarithmically as the input size increases. Typically occurs in algorithms that halve the problem size at each step, like binary search.\nExample: Binary search.\nEfficiency: Very good for large inputs.\n\nO(n) - Linear Time:\n\nDescription: The runtime increases linearly with the size of the input. If you double the input size, the runtime also doubles.\nExample: Linear search, iterating through a list.\nEfficiency: Reasonable for moderate to large inputs.\n\nO(n log n) - Log-Linear Time:\n\nDescription: The runtime increases more than linearly but less than quadratically. Common in efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort and quicksort.\nExample: Merge sort, quicksort, heap sort.\nEfficiency: Efficient for large inputs.\n\nO(n^2) - Quadratic Time:\n\nDescription: The runtime increases quadratically with the size of the input. If you double the input size, the runtime quadruples.\nExample: Bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort (for unsorted arrays).\nEfficiency: Poor for large inputs.\n\nO(2n) - Exponential Time:\n\nDescription: The runtime doubles with each additional element in the input. Common in algorithms that solve problems by brute force or explore all possible solutions.\nExample: Recursive algorithms for the Fibonacci sequence, certain dynamic programming problems.\nEfficiency: Very poor, impractical for large inputs.\n\nO(n!) - Factorial Time:\n\nDescription: The runtime increases factorially with the size of the input. Common in algorithms that generate all permutations of an input set.\nExample: Traveling salesman problem via brute force.\nEfficiency: Extremely poor, infeasible for even moderate input sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Complexity\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Case, Worst Case, and Average Case\n\nBest Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the minimum possible number of operations. It’s often less relevant because it’s optimistic.\n\nExample: For linear search, the best case is \\(O(1)\\), where the target element is the first one in the array.\n\nWorst Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the maximum possible number of operations. Big O notation typically describes the worst-case complexity.\n\nExample: For linear search, the worst case is \\(O(n)\\), where the target element is the last one in the array or isn’t present at all.\n\nAverage Case: The scenario that represents the expected number of operations for a typical input. It’s more complex to calculate because it depends on the distribution of inputs.\n\nExample: For linear search, the average case is \\(O(n/2)\\), but in Big O notation, we simplify this to \\(O(n)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculation Rules\n\n\n\n\n\nIgnore Constants:\n\nRule: In Big O notation, constant factors are ignored.\nWhy: Big O notation focuses on the growth rate as the input size \\((n)\\) increases, so a constant multiplier doesn’t affect the growth rate.\nExample: \\(O(2n)\\) simplifies to \\(O(n)\\)\n\nFocus on the Dominant Term:\n\nRule: Only the term with the highest growth rate is considered.\nWhy: As n becomes large, the term with the highest growth rate will dominate the others.\nExample: \\(O(n2+n)\\) simplifies to \\(O(n2)\\)\n\nDrop Lower Order Terms:\n\nRule: Lower-order terms are ignored because they become insignificant as n grows.\nWhy: Similar to focusing on the dominant term, lower-order terms have a negligible impact on large inputs.\nExample: \\(O(n2 + n + log n)\\) simplifies to \\(O(n2)\\)\n\nMultiplicative Constants Can Be Ignored: - Rule: Coefficients that multiply variables (e.g., 2n, 3n^2) are ignored. - Why: Like constants, they don’t change the growth rate. - Example: \\(O(3n2)\\) simplifies to \\(O(n2)\\)\nAdditive Constants Can Be Ignored:\n\nRule: Constant terms that don’t depend on n are ignored.\nWhy: They don’t affect the overall growth rate as n increases.\nExample: \\(O(n+10)\\) simplifies to \\(O(n)\\)\n\nLogarithms with Different Bases:\n\nRule: Logarithms with different bases can be considered equivalent in Big O notation.\nWhy: Changing the base of a logarithm only introduces a constant factor, which is ignored in Big O notation.\nExample: \\(\\text{O(log⁡2 n)}\\) simplifies to \\(\\text{O(log⁡ n)}\\)\n\nNon-Dominant Polynomial Terms:\n\nRule: In polynomials, only the highest degree term is considered.\nWhy: As n grows large, the highest degree term will dominate.\nExample: \\(\\text{O(5n3 + 2n2 + 7)}\\) simplifies to \\(O(n3)\\)\n\nExponential Growth:\n\nRule: Exponential growth functions dominate polynomial functions.\nWhy: Exponential functions grow much faster than polynomial functions as n increases.\nExample: \\(\\text{O(2n + n3)}\\) simplifies to \\(O(2n)\\)\n\nNested Loops:\n\nRule: The time complexity of nested loops is the product of the complexities of each loop.\nWhy: Each loop iterates based on the input size, so their combined effect is multiplicative.\nExample: A loop inside another loop both running n times results in \\(\\text{O(n * n) = O(n2)}\\)\n\nSequential Statements:\n\nRule: If two independent statements (or loops) are executed sequentially, their time complexities are added.\nWhy: Sequential operations don’t multiply time complexity, but rather add up.\nExample: Two loops each running n times sequentially result in \\(\\text{O(n + n) = O(n)}\\)",

It defines the operations that can be performed on the data and the way the data is stored in memory.\n\n\n\nPrimitive Data Types: These are the basic building blocks of data in a programming language.\n\nInteger (e.g., int in C, Java): Holds whole numbers.\nFloating Point (e.g., float, double): Holds numbers with fractional parts.\nCharacter (e.g., char): Holds a single character.\nBoolean (e.g., bool): Holds a true or false value.\n\nComposite Data Types: These are constructed from primitive types.\n\nArrays: A collection of elements of the same data type.\nStructures (e.g., struct in C): A collection of different data types.\n\nUser-Defined Data Types: Created by the user, typically by combining primitive data types.\n\nEnumerations (enum), Classes, etc.\n\n\n\n\nEnumeration:\n\nEnumeration, often referred to as “enum,” is a data type in programming that allows a variable to be a set of predefined constants.\nThese constants are typically related and represent a set of possible values that a variable of the enumeration type can hold.\nEnums improve code readability, make it easier to manage sets of related values, and reduce errors by limiting the values a variable can take.\n\nKey Concepts of Enumeration:\n\nDefinition: An enumeration is defined using the enum keyword (syntax can vary by language). It consists of a set of named constants, each representing a unique value.\nValues: The values in an enum are usually integers by default, starting from 0, but they can be assigned specific values as needed.\nUsage: Enums are commonly used when a variable can only take one out of a small set of possible values, like days of the week, directions, states, etc.\n\nExample in Different Languages:\nC/C++\n\nenum Direction {\n    NORTH,\n    EAST,\n    SOUTH,\n    WEST\n};\n\nDirection dir = NORTH;\n\nJava\n\npublic enum Direction {\n    NORTH,\n    EAST,\n    SOUTH,\n    WEST\n}\n\nDirection dir = Direction.NORTH;\n\nPython (using enum module)\n\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nclass Direction(Enum):\n    NORTH = 1\n    EAST = 2\n    SOUTH = 3\n    WEST = 4\n\ndir = Direction.NORTH\n\nAdvantages of Using Enums: - Readability: Code is easier to read and understand. - Maintainability: Easier to update and maintain related values. - Type Safety: Prevents assigning invalid values to variables of the enum type.\nEnums are useful in scenarios where a variable should only be allowed to take one out of a small set of specific values, helping prevent errors and making the code clearer and more reliable.\nKey Characteristics: - Memory Allocation: Data types determine how much memory is allocated for storing the data. - Operations: Each data type supports a set of operations, like arithmetic operations for integers or concatenation for strings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Structures\n\n\n\nDefinitionExamples\n\n\nWhat is a Data Structure?\n\nDefinition: A data structure is a specific way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Data structures use data types as their underlying foundation.\n\n\n\n\nArrays: A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.\nLinked Lists: A series of connected nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.\nStacks: A collection of elements with Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) access.\nQueues: A collection of elements with First-In-First-Out (FIFO) access.\nTrees: A hierarchical structure with a root element and sub-elements called nodes.\nGraphs: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.\nHash Tables: A data structure that maps keys to values for efficient lookup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract Data Types (ADTs)\n\n\n\nDefinitionExamples\n\n\n\nDefinition: An abstract data type (ADT) is a theoretical model of a data structure that defines the behavior from the user’s point of view, without specifying the underlying implementation. It specifies the operations that can be performed and the expected behavior but not how these operations are carried out.\n\n\n\n\nList ADT: Operations include insertion, deletion, and access by index.\nStack ADT: Operations include push, pop, and peek.\nQueue ADT: Operations include enqueue and dequeue.\nMap (or Dictionary) ADT: Operations include inserting, deleting, and searching for key-value pairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferences\n\n\n\n1. Abstraction2. Purpose3. Implementation4. Examples\n\n\n\nData Types: The most basic level; concerned with how data is stored and what operations are allowed.\nData Structures: A step higher in abstraction; concerned with how data is organized and accessed.\nADTs: The highest level of abstraction; concerned with the operations and behavior of a data structure, abstracted away from the implementation details.\n\n\n\n\nData Types: Define the type and nature of the data.\nData Structures: Provide a way to organize and manage data efficiently.\nADTs: Define a blueprint for data structures, focusing on what operations can be performed and what their expected behavior is.\n\n\n\n\nData Types: Directly supported by the programming language.\nData Structures: Built using data types and can be complex.\nADTs: Can be implemented using various data structures; the choice of implementation depends on the specific needs like performance and memory usage.\n\n\n\n\nData Types: int, float, char, bool\nData Structures: Arrays, linked lists, trees, hash tables\nADTs: Stack, queue, list, set, map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArray\n\n\n\n1.

If the array is full (fixed size), you may need to resize it.\n\nTime Complexity: \\(O(1)\\) (amortized if resizing is needed).\n\nAt a Specific Index: Shift elements to the right from the index to create space, then insert the new element.\n\nTime Complexity: \\(O(n)\\), where n is the number of elements after the insertion point.\n\n\nDeletion:\n\nFrom the End: Remove the last element.\n\nTime Complexity: \\(O(1)\\).\n\nFrom a Specific Index: Shift elements to the left to fill the gap left by the removed element.\n\nTime Complexity: \\(O(n)\\), where n is the number of elements after the removal point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Cases:\n\nSuitable for scenarios where fast access to elements is required, and the size of the data set is known.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinked List\n\n\n\nDescriptionTypesOperationsUsage\n\n\n\nA linked list is a linear collection of elements called nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.\nPython Equivalent: Custom class with Node and LinkedList classes\n\n\n\n\nSingly Linked List: Each node points to the next node.\nDoubly Linked List: Each node points to both the next and previous nodes.\nCircular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node, forming a loop.\n\n\n\n\nAccess: \\(O(n)\\) — Requires traversal from the head to the desired node.\nSearch: \\(O(n)\\) — Requires traversal to find the target element.\nInsertion:\n\nAt the Beginning (Singly/ Doubly Linked List): Create a new node and adjust the head (and possibly tail in a doubly linked list).\n\nTime Complexity: \\(O(1)\\).\n\nAt the End (Singly Linked List): Traverse to the last node, then insert the new node.\n\nTime Complexity: \\(O(n)\\).\n\nAt a Specific Position: Traverse to the position and insert the node, adjusting the pointers.\n\nTime Complexity: \\(O(n)\\).\n\n\nDeletion:\n\nFrom the Beginning: Adjust the head pointer to the next node.\n\nTime Complexity: \\(O(1)\\).\n\nFrom the End: Traverse to the second last node, adjust its pointer to null.\n\nTime Complexity: \\(O(n)\\).\n\nFrom a Specific Position: Traverse to the node before the one to remove, then adjust pointers to bypass the removed node.\n\nTime Complexity: \\(O(n)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Cases:\n\nUseful when the size of the data set is unknown or when frequent insertions and deletions are required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods for Lists/Arrays\n\n\n\nI …II …III …IV …V …\n\n\n\nappend()\n\nDescription: Adds an element to the end of the list.\nSyntax: list.append(element)\n\n\nExample:\n\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\"]\nfruits.append(\"orange\")\nprint(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']\n\n['apple', 'banana', 'orange']\n\n\n\nextend()\n\nDescription: Extends the list by appending elements from another iterable (e.g., another list).\nSyntax: list.extend(iterable)\n\n\nExample:\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3]\nnumbers.extend([4, 5])\nprint(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n\n\n\n\ninsert() - Description: Inserts an element at a specific index in the list. - Syntax: list.insert(index, element)\nExample:\n\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\"]\nfruits.insert(1, \"orange\")\nprint(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'orange', 'banana']\n\n['apple', 'orange', 'banana']\n\n\n\nremove()\n\nDescription: Removes the first occurrence of a specified value from the list.\nSyntax: list.remove(element)\n\n\nExample:\n\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"]\nfruits.remove(\"banana\")\nprint(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'orange']\n\n['apple', 'orange']\n\n\n\n\n\n\npop()\n\nDescription: Removes and returns the element at the specified index.

Each of these provides a way to group multiple fields (attributes) together under one name, similar to how a record in other languages might work.\n\n\n\n\nStack\n\n\n\nDescriptionOperationsUsage\n\n\n\nA stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added is the first one to be removed.\nPython Equivalent: list or collections.deque\n\n\n\n\nPush (Insertion): \\(O(1)\\) — Add an element to the top of the stack.\nPop (Deletion): \\(O(1)\\) — Remove the top element from the stack.\nPeek/Top: \\(O(1)\\) — View the top element without removing it.\nIsEmpty: \\(O(1)\\) — Check if the stack is empty.\n\n\n\n\nUse Cases:\n\nUsed in expression evaluation, backtracking algorithms, undo mechanisms in applications, and for maintaining function call stacks in recursion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBag\n\n\n\nDescriptionOperationsUsage\n\n\n\nA Bag (also known as a multiset) is a simple data structure that allows for storing a collection of elements where duplicate elements are allowed.

It ensures efficient data retrieval by minimizing the number of comparisons required.\n\n\nHash Function - A hash function is a function that converts input (key) into a fixed-size value, typically an integer, which serves as an index in the hash table array. - A good hash function has the following properties:\n  - **Deterministic:** The same key always produces the same hash value.\n  - **Uniform Distribution:** The hash values should be distributed uniformly across the array to minimize collisions.\n  - **Fast Computation:** The function should be quick to compute.\n\nHash Keys\n\nHash Key: The key for which the hash function generates an index.\nHash Value: The integer index produced by the hash function.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to perform hash function on calculator\nTo determine where the data associated with the last 4 digits of the Social Security number (‘2023’) will be stored in the array, follow these steps:\n1. Understand the Hash Function: The problem specifies a hash function given by key % 1009. Here, % denotes the modulus operation. This operation returns the remainder of the division of key by 1009.\n2. Determine the Key: The last 4 digits of the Social Security number are ‘2023’. Therefore, the key you’re interested in is 2023.\n3. Apply the Hash Function: Use the hash function to find the index in the array where the data should be stored. Specifically, you need to compute:\na. Key / Hash - (whole number in result) * Hash\n  i. For this example\n    1. $(2023 / 1009) = 2.004955401$\n    2. $2.004955401 - 2 = 0.004955401$\n    3. $0.004955401 * 1009 = 5$\n4. By calculating the remainder, you will find the index in the array soc where the data associated with the key ‘2023’ will be stored.\na. soc[5]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTree\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\nA tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node contains a value and references to child nodes.

This classification impacts how and when variables are allocated and accessed in memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatic Variable Declaration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\nStatic variables are allocated memory at compile time, and their type and size are known before the program runs. The memory for static variables is typically allocated on the stack or in the data segment of memory.\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\nFixed Size: The size and type of the variable are determined at compile time.\nMemory Allocation: Memory is allocated during compilation and deallocated when the program exits or the variable goes out of scope.\nScope and Lifetime: - Scope: The scope (visibility) of static variables is determined by where they are declared (e.g., within a function or globally). - Lifetime: The variable’s lifetime extends for the duration of the program or the block in which it is declared.\n\n\n\n\nExamples\nC/C++:\n\nint main() {\n    int x = 10; // Static variable\n    return 0;\n}\n\nHere, x is a static variable with a fixed size and type, determined at compile time.\nJava:\n\npublic class Example {\n    static int x = 10; // Static class variable\n}\n\nIn Java, x is a static variable of the class Example, meaning it belongs to the class rather than any specific instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Variable Declaration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\nDynamic variables are allocated memory at runtime. Their type and size are determined while the program is executing, and they are often managed using dynamic memory allocation functions or constructs.\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\nFlexible Size: The size and type of the variable can be determined and adjusted at runtime.\nMemory Allocation: Memory is allocated on the heap or through dynamic memory management constructs, and deallocated when no longer needed.\nScope and Lifetime: - Scope: The scope of dynamic variables is determined by how they are referenced in the code. - Lifetime: The lifetime of a dynamic variable extends from the point of allocation to the point of deallocation.\n\n\n\n\nExamples\nC/C++:\n\nint* ptr = (int*) malloc(sizeof(int)); // Dynamic memory allocation\n*ptr = 10;\nfree(ptr); // Deallocate memory\n\nPython:\n\nx = [10]  # Dynamic variable (list with one element)\nx.append(20)  # Modify the list\n\nIn Python, x can dynamically grow in size as new elements are added to the list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrongly-typed vs Weakly-typed\n\nStrongly-Typed Languages\n\n\n\nDefinition:Key Characteristics:Examples:\n\n\nIn strongly-typed languages, the type of a variable is strictly enforced. This means that once a variable is assigned a specific type, it cannot be implicitly converted to another type without explicit conversion.\n\n\n\nStrict Type Enforcement: Operations between incompatible types will result in a compile-time or runtime error. For example, you cannot add a string to an integer without explicitly converting one of them.\nFewer Implicit Conversions: Strongly-typed languages avoid automatic type coercion, where one type is automatically converted to another.\nType Safety: The language provides more safety by catching type-related errors early, often at compile time.\n\n\n\n\nJava: You cannot assign a string to an integer variable without explicit conversion.\n\n\n\nint x = \"5\"; // Compile-time error\n\n\n\nC#: You must explicitly cast types when necessary.\n\n\n\nint x = 10;\nstring y = \"5\";\nint result = x + int.Parse(y); // Correct\n\n\n\nPython: While dynamically typed, Python is strongly-typed as it does not allow implicit conversion between incompatible types.\n\n\n\nx = 10\ny = \"5\"\nresult = x + y  # Runtime error\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeakly-typed Languages\n\n\n\nDefinition:Key Characteristics:Examples:\n\n\nIn weakly-typed languages, the type system is more flexible, allowing implicit conversions between types. The language may automatically convert one type to another as needed, often during runtime.\n\n\n\nImplicit Type Coercion: The language can automatically convert types in certain situations, such as adding a number to a string by converting the number to a string.\nLess Type Safety: While more flexible, weakly-typed languages may introduce subtle bugs due to unintended type coercions that go unnoticed.\nEase of Use: In some scenarios, weak typing can make code easier to write and understand, especially for quick scripting tasks.\n\n\n\n\nJavaScript: Automatically converts types when needed.\n\n\n\nlet x = 10;\nlet y = \"5\";\nlet result = x + y; // \"105\" (y is converted to a string)\n\n\n\nPHP: Also allows implicit type conversion.\n\n\n\n$x = 10;\n$y = \"5\";\n$result = $x + $y; // 15 (y is converted to a number)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison between Types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison: Strongly-Typed vs. Weakly-Typed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType Safety: Strongly-typed languages provide more safety by enforcing type rules, reducing errors due to unintended type conversions. Weakly-typed languages sacrifice some of this safety for flexibility.\nFlexibility: Weakly-typed languages allow for more flexible and often shorter code, especially in cases where automatic type conversion is beneficial.\nError Handling: Strongly-typed languages catch type-related errors early, often at compile time, while weakly-typed languages may only reveal such errors at runtime, if at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment operators\n\nSimple Assignment (=): Assigns a value to a variable.\nCompound Assignment:\n\n+=: Addition\n-=: Subtraction\n*=: Multiplication\n/=: Division\n//=: Floor Division\n%=: Modulus\n**=: Exponentiation\nBitwise Operators: &=, |=, ^=, &lt;&lt;=, &gt;&gt;=\n\n\nAssignment operators streamline code by combining operations and assignments into a single step, making code more concise and often more readable.\n\n\nOrder of operations / precedence rules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperations & Rules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Arithmetic Operations\n\nParentheses: () - Expressions inside parentheses are evaluated first. - Example: \\(\\text{(2 + 3) * 4}\\) evaluates to 20.\nExponentiation: ** (or ^ in some languages like Excel) - Raises a number to the power of another number. - Example: \\(\\text{2 ** 3}\\) evaluates to 8.\nUnary Plus and Minus: +, - (unary) - Unary plus and minus are applied next. - Example: \\(\\text{-5 + 3}\\) evaluates to -2.\nMultiplication and Division: *, /, // (floor division), % (modulus) - Multiplication and division have the same precedence, evaluated from left to right. - Example: \\(\\text{6 / 2 * 3}\\) evaluates to 9.\nAddition and Subtraction: +, - - Addition and subtraction have the same precedence, evaluated from left to right. - Example: \\(\\text{5 + 3 - 2}\\) evaluates to 6.\n\n\n\n\n2. Comparison Operations\n\nEquality and Inequality: \\(==\\), \\(!=\\) - Checks if two values are equal or not equal.\nRelational Operators: \\(&gt;\\), \\(&lt;\\), \\(&gt;=\\), \\(&lt;=\\) - Compares two values to determine the relationship between them.\n\n\n\n\n3. Logical Operations\n\nNegation: not - Evaluates to the opposite Boolean value.\nAnd: and - Evaluates to True if both operands are True.\nOr: or - Evaluates to True if at least one operand is True.\n\n\n\n\n4. Assignment Operators\n\nSimple Assignment: \\(=\\) - Assigns a value to a variable.\nCompound Assignment: \\(+=\\), \\(-=\\), \\(*=\\), \\(/=\\), etc. - Performs an operation and assigns the result to a variable.\n\n\n\n\n5. Bitwise Operations\n\nBitwise Not: \\(\\text{~}\\) - Inverts all bits of the operand.\nBitwise And: \\(\\text{&}\\) - Performs a bitwise AND operation.\nBitwise Or: \\(|\\) - Performs a bitwise OR operation.\nBitwise XOR: \\(\\text{^}\\) - Performs a bitwise XOR operation.\nBitwise Shift: \\(&lt;&lt;\\), \\(&gt;&gt;\\) - Shifts bits to the left or right.\n\n\n\n\n6. Miscellaneous\n\nFunction Calls - Functions are evaluated first, from innermost to outermost.\nMember Access: \\(.\\) (dot operator) - Accesses properties or methods of an object.\nIndexing and Slicing: \\(\\text{[ ]}\\) - Retrieves or modifies elements from collections like lists or arrays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoops\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Loops\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\nFor Loop\n\nDescription: The for loop iterates over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) or a range of numbers, executing a block of code for each item.\n\n\n# Iterating over a list\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfor number in numbers:\n    print(number)\n\n# Iterating over a range\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(i)\n\nWhile Loop\n\nDescription: The while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains True.\n\n\n# Looping while a condition is True\ncount = 0\nwhile count &lt; 5:\n    print(count)\n    count += 1\n\nDo-While Loop\n\nDescription: The do-while loop (available in C/C++ but not in Python) executes a block of code at least once and then repeatedly executes it as long as a condition remains True.\n\n\n// Looping at least once and then while a condition is True\nint count = 0;\ndo {\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; count &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n    count++;\n} while (count &lt; 5);\n\nBreak\n\nDescription: Exits the loop immediately, regardless of the loop’s condition.\n\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    if i == 5:\n        break\n    print(i)\n\nContinue\n\nDescription: Skips the rest of the code inside the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration.\n\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n        continue\n    print(i)\n\nPass\n\nDescription: In Python, pass is a placeholder statement used when a statement is syntactically required but you do not want to execute any code.\n\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n        pass  # Do nothing\n    else:\n        print(i)\n\nNested Loops\n\nDescription: You can nest loops inside other loops to perform more complex iterations.\n\n\nfor i in range(3):\n    for j in range(2):\n        print(f\"i={i}, j={j}\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConditional statements / branching\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Statements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nIf Statement\n\nDescription: The if statement executes a block of code if its condition is True.\n\n\n\nx = 10\nif x &gt; 5:\n    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n\n\nIf-Else Statement\n\nDescription: The if-else statement executes one block of code if the condition is True, and another block if it is False.\n\n\n\nx = 3\nif x &gt; 5:\n    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is 5 or less\")\n\nx is 5 or less\n\n\n\nIf-Elif-Else Statement\n\nDescription: The if-elif-else statement allows for multiple conditions to be checked in sequence. If the if condition is False, it checks elif (else if) conditions in order, and finally executes the else block if none of the conditions are True.\n\n\n\nx = 7\nif x &gt; 10:\n    print(\"x is greater than 10\")\nelif x == 7:\n    print(\"x is 7\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is less than 10 and not 7\")\n\n\nSwitch-Case Statement\n\nDescription: The switch-case statement (used in C/C++ and some other languages but not Python) provides a way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of an expression.\n\n\n\nint day = 3;\nswitch (day) {\n    case 1:\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; \"Monday\" &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n        break;\n    case 2:\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; \"Tuesday\" &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n        break;\n    case 3:\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; \"Wednesday\" &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n        break;\n    default:\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; \"Other day\" &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n}\n\n\nAND Operator\n\nDescription: Returns True if both conditions are True.\nSyntax:\n\nPython/C/C++: condition1 and condition2\n\nExample:\n\nPython: if x &gt; 0 and x &lt; 10 :\nC++: if (x &gt; 0 && x &lt; 10)\n\n\nOR Operator\n\nDescription: Returns True if at least one of the conditions is True.\nSyntax:\n\nPython/C/C++: condition1 or condition2\n\nExample:\n\nPython: if x &lt; 0 or x &gt; 10 :\nC++: if (x &lt; 0 || x &gt; 10)\n\n\nNOT Operator\n\nDescription: Returns the opposite Boolean value of the condition.\nSyntax:\n\nPython/C/C++: not condition\n\nExample:\n\nPython: if not x &gt; 5 :\nC++: if (!(x &gt; 5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClasses\n\n\nDefinition\nA class is essentially a template for creating objects. It encapsulates data for the object and methods to operate on that data.\n\nclass ClassName:\n    def __init__(self, attribute1, attribute2):\n        self.attribute1 = attribute1\n        self.attribute2 = attribute2\n\n    def method_name(self):\n        # Method code\n\n\n\nComponents of a Class\n\n\n\n1. Attributes:2. Methods:3. Constructor:4. Destructor:\n\n\nVariables that hold data related to the class. They define the state of an object.\n\nPython: Defined within the __init__ method using self.\nC++: Defined within the class, often with private access and initialized via a constructor.\n\n\n\nFunctions defined within a class that operate on its attributes or perform actions.\n\nPython: Defined with def keyword within the class.\nC++: Defined with the function signature inside the class and implemented outside the class body.\n\n\n\nA special method that initializes objects of the class. It is called when an object is created.\n\nPython: __init__ method.\nC++: Defined with the class name and no return type.\n\n\n\nA method that cleans up when an object is destroyed (in C++). Python manages memory automatically, so a destructor is less commonly used.\n\nPython: __del__ method (optional).\nC++: Destructor defined with ~ClassName().\n\n\nclass Car:\n    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n        self.make = make\n        self.model = model\n        self.year = year\n\n    def display_info(self):\n        print(f\"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}\")\n\n# Creating an object of the class\nmy_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2022)\nmy_car.display_info()  # Output: 2022 Toyota Corolla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritance\n\n\n\nDefinition:Example:\n\n\nInheritance allows you to create a new class that is based on an existing class, inheriting its attributes and methods.\n\n\n\nclass ParentClass:\n    # Parent class code\n\nclass ChildClass(ParentClass):\n    # Child class code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEncapsulation\n\n\n\nDefinition:Access Specifiers:\n\n\nEncapsulation is the concept of restricting access to certain details of an object’s implementation. It involves using access specifiers to control the visibility of attributes and methods.\n\n\n\nPython: Uses naming conventions (e.g., _private or __private) rather than strict access specifiers.\nC++: Uses public, protected, and private keywords to control access.\n\n\nclass BankAccount: \n  def __init__(self, balance):\n  self.__balance = balance\n\n  def deposit(self, amount):\n      if amount &gt; 0:\n          self.__balance += amount\n\n  def get_balance(self):\n      return self.__balance\n\n# Creating an object of the class\naccount = BankAccount(1000)\naccount.deposit(500)\nprint(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolymorphism\n\n\n\nDefinition:Example:\n\n\nPolymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class, typically through method overriding.\n\n\n\nclass Animal:\n    def speak(self):\n        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n\nclass Dog(Animal):\n    def speak(self):\n        print(\"Dog barks\")\n\ndef make_animal_speak(animal):\n    animal.speak()\n\n# Creating objects\nanimal = Animal()\ndog = Dog()\n\nmake_animal_speak(animal)  # Output: Animal speaks\nmake_animal_speak(dog)     # Output: Dog barks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nClasses: Define custom data types with attributes and methods.\nInheritance: Create new classes based on existing ones, inheriting their properties and methods.\nEncapsulation: Restrict access to certain parts of an object’s implementation.\nPolymorphism: Allow different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class, often through method overriding.",
