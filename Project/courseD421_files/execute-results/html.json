The empty set is sometimes referred to as the **null set** and can \nalso be denoted by $\\{ \\}$. A **finite set** has a finite number of elements. \nAn **infinite set** has an infinite number of elements. The cardinality of a \nfinite set is the number of elements in that set, and is denoted as $|\\thinspace|$.\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"vembedr embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\">\n<div>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UqulNbiHrrU\" width=\"533\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" data-external=\"1\" class=\"embed-responsive-item\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {#tbl-panel layout-ncol=2}\n| Symbol | Set                                                                                                               | Example |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|\n| $\\mathbb{N}$      | The set of natural numbers: All integers greater than or equal to 0.                                              | $0, 1, 2$    |\n| $\\mathbb{Z}$      | The set of all integers.                                                                                          | $..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...$    |\n| $\\mathbb{Q}$      | The set of rational numbers: All real numbers that can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers and b ≠ 0. | $0,\\thinspace 1/2,\\thinspace 5.23, \\thinspace -5/3$    |\n| $\\mathbb{R}$      | The set of real numbers.                                                                                          | $0, 1/2, 5.23, -5/3,\\thinspace \\pi, \\sqrt{2}$ |\n\n: Common Math Sets {#tbl-first .striped .hover}\n\n| Symbol            | Set |\n|------------------ |------|\n| $\\mathbb{R^+}$    | The set of all positive real numbers.    |\n| $\\mathbb{R^-}$    | The set of all negative real numbers.    |\n| $\\mathbb{Z^+}$    | The set of all positive integers.    |\n| $\\mathbb{Z^-}$    | The set of all negative integers    |\n\n: Superscripts {#tbl-second}\n\nMath Symbol Examples\n:::\n\n<br>\n\nA number x is **positive** if $x > 0$.

This property can be expressed mathematically or in a form of a sentence.\n\n## Step-3\n\nRemember that positive integers are whole positive numbers, also called natural \nnumbers. This set consists of numbers $1,2,3,….$ Therefore, integers that are \nless than $12$ are\n\n::: {.text-center}\n$1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11$\n:::\n\nThese are the elements of our set, which we can also denote as\n\n::: {.text-center}\n$\\{x∣ x \\text{ is a positive integer less than } 12\\} = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11\\}$\n:::\n\n## Step-4\n\nLet's recap what we have done. We recalled what the set of positive integers is, \nand then identified the ones that are less than $12$. These are the whole \nnumbers from $1$ to $11$, and they are the only elements of our set.\n\n## Results\n\n::: {.text-center}\n$1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11$\n:::\n\n<!-- end panel -->\n:::\n\n\n::: {.lead}\n###### Exercise 1c\n:::\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Step-1\n\nThe goal of this exercise is to list all elements of the set\n\n**What is a set?**\n\n## Step-2\n\nA **set** is an unordered collection of objects that satisfy a certain property. \nThis property can be expressed mathematically or in a form of a sentence.\n\n## Step-3\n\nIn part $b)\\,$ we recalled that integers are whole numbers. Their squares are positive \nwhole numbers, or natural numbers. Suppose that a is an integer such that\n\n::: {.text-center}\n$a^2=x$\n:::\n\nSince $10^2=100$, and we know that $x<100$, it follows that\n\n::: {.text-center}\n$a^2 < 10^2 ⟹ \\sqrt{a^2} > \\sqrt{10^2} ⟹ |a| < |10| ⟹ |a| < 10$\n:::\n\nTherefore, $a$ is an integer whose absolute value is smaller than $10$. The list \nof possible values of a is\n\n::: {.text-center}\n$0,\\thinspace±1,\\thinspace±2,\\thinspace±3,\\thinspace±4,\\thinspace±5,\\thinspace±6,\\thinspace±7,\\thinspace±8,\\thinspace±9$\n:::\n\nConsequently, the list of all possible values of x, which is the square of a is\n\n::: {text-center}\n$0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81$\n:::\n\nHence, there are $10$ elements of our set.\n\n\n## Step-4\n\nLet's recap what we have done.\n\nFirst, we identified that the absolute value of an integer whose square is less \nthan $100$ is smaller than $10$. Then, we listed them and found their squares, \nwhich are the elements of our set.\n\n## Results\n\n::: {text-center}\n$0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81$\n:::\n\n<!-- end panel -->\n:::\n\n<!-- end callout -->\n:::\n\n\n",
