A **set** is a collection of objects. The objects in a set are called **elements**. 
The **roster notation** definition of a set is a list of the elements enclosed 
in curly braces with the individual elements separated by commas.

The set with no elements is called the **empty set** and is denoted by the 
symbol $∅$. The empty set is sometimes referred to as the **null set** and can 
also be denoted by $\{ \}$. A **finite set** has a finite number of elements. 
An **infinite set** has an infinite number of elements. The cardinality of a 
finite set is the number of elements in that set, and is denoted as $|\thinspace|$.

Math Symbol Examples
:::

<br>

A number x is **positive** if $x > 0$. A number x is **negative** if $x < 0$. The 
number $0$ is neither positive nor negative, so $0 \in \mathbb{Z^+}$ and $0 \in \mathbb{Z^-}$,
and a number $x$ is **non-negative** if $x ≥ 0$.

In **set builder notation**, a set is defined by specifying that the set includes 
all elements in a larger set that also satisfy certain conditions.

::: {.text-center}
$\mathbb{A} = { x \in \mathbb{S} : \mathbb{P}(x) }$

*$\mathbb{S}$ is the larger set from which the elements in $\mathbb{S}$ are taken.*

## Equal Subsets

::: {.text-center}
**set** $\subseteq$ **set**
:::

Equal sets $\{ \}$ can be considered subsets $\subseteq$. Meaning all of a
set's elements must be found in the other set (superset).

$\mathbb{A}= \{ \mathbb{a, b, c, d, e} \}$

$\mathbb{B}= \{ \mathbb{e, b, c, a, d} \}$

::: {.text-center}
$\mathbb{B} \subseteq \mathbb{A}$
:::

## Proper Subsets

::: {.text-center}
**set** $\subset$ **set**
:::

With **proper subsets** $\subset$, equality is not possible. Meaning, a set that is a subset
$\subseteq$ with lesser elements than the superset is considered a proper subset. 

$\mathbb{A}= \{ \mathbb{a, b, c, d, e} \}$

$\mathbb{B}= \{ \mathbb{e, b, c, a, d} \}$

$\mathbb{C}= \{ \mathbb{e, c, a} \}$

::: {.text-center}
$\mathbb{C} \subset \mathbb{A}$ **or** $\mathbb{C} \subset \mathbb{B}$

###### Exercise 1a
:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Step-1

The goal of this exercise is to list all elements of the set

::: {.text-center}
$\{x∣x \text{ is a real number such that } x^2=1\}$
:::

**What is a set?**

## Step-2

A **set** is an unordered collection of objects that satisfy a certain 
property. This property can be expressed mathematically or in a form of a sentence.

## Step-3

Let's identify all real numbers $x$ for which $x^2=1$.

::: {.text-center}
$x^2 = 1 ⟹ x = ± 1 ⟹ x = ± 1$
:::

Therefore, elements of the given set are $−1$ and $1$. We can also write this as

::: {.text-center}
$\{x∣x \text{ is a real number such that } x^2=1\} = \{-1, 1\}$.
:::

## Step-4

Let's recap what we have done.

We determined that the real numbers whose square is equal to $1$ are $−1$ and $1$, 
and that they are the only elements of this set.

## Results

::: {.text-center}
$−1,1$

###### Exercise 1b
:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Step-1

The goal of this exercise is to list all elements of the set

::: {.text-center}
$\{x∣ x \text{ is a positive integer less than } 12\}$
:::

**What is a set?**

## Step-2

A **set** is an unordered collection of objects that satisfy a certain 
property. This property can be expressed mathematically or in a form of a sentence.

## Step-3

Remember that positive integers are whole positive numbers, also called natural 
numbers. This set consists of numbers $1,2,3,….$ Therefore, integers that are 
less than $12$ are

::: {.text-center}
$1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11$
:::

These are the elements of our set, which we can also denote as

::: {.text-center}
$\{x∣ x \text{ is a positive integer less than } 12\} = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11\}$
:::

## Step-4

Let's recap what we have done. We recalled what the set of positive integers is, 
and then identified the ones that are less than $12$. These are the whole 
numbers from $1$ to $11$, and they are the only elements of our set.

## Results

::: {.text-center}
$1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11$
:::

<!-- end panel -->

###### Exercise 1c
:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Step-1

The goal of this exercise is to list all elements of the set

**What is a set?**

## Step-2

A **set** is an unordered collection of objects that satisfy a certain property. 
This property can be expressed mathematically or in a form of a sentence.

## Step-3

In part $b)\,$ we recalled that integers are whole numbers. Their squares are positive 
whole numbers, or natural numbers. Suppose that a is an integer such that

::: {.text-center}
$a^2=x$
:::

Since $10^2=100$, and we know that $x<100$, it follows that

::: {.text-center}
$a^2 < 10^2 ⟹ \sqrt{a^2} > \sqrt{10^2} ⟹ |a| < |10| ⟹ |a| < 10$
:::

Therefore, $a$ is an integer whose absolute value is smaller than $10$. The list 
of possible values of a is

::: {.text-center}
$0,\thinspace±1,\thinspace±2,\thinspace±3,\thinspace±4,\thinspace±5,\thinspace±6,\thinspace±7,\thinspace±8,\thinspace±9$
:::

Consequently, the list of all possible values of x, which is the square of a is

::: {text-center}
$0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81$
:::

Hence, there are $10$ elements of our set.


## Step-4

Let's recap what we have done.

First, we identified that the absolute value of an integer whose square is less 
than $100$ is smaller than $10$. Then, we listed them and found their squares, 
which are the elements of our set.

## Results

::: {text-center}
$0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81$
