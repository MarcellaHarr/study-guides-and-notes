###### Exercise 1a
:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Step-1

In this exercise, we determine whether the given statement represents a proposition.

**What is a proposition?**

## Step-2

A **proposition** is a statement that is known to be true or known to be false. 
If we don't know if a statement is true or false, then the statement is not a 
proposition.

## Step-3

**(a)**

The statement is a proposition because we know that the statement is true 
$T$ *(as Boston is the capital of Massachusetts)*.

## Step-4

Let us summarize how the results were derived.

To determine whether a statement is a proposition, we determined whether the 
statement was true or false.

If we were able to derive a truth value, then the statement has to be a proposition.
If we were unable to assign a truth value to the statement or the truth value 
was dependent on some variable, then the statement couldn't be a proposition.

## Results

*(a) Proposition, $T$*

###### Exercise 1b

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Step-1

In this exercise, we determine whether the given statement represents a proposition.

**What is a proposition?**

## Step-2

A **proposition** is a statement that is known to be true or known to be false. 
If we don't know if a statement is true or false, then the statement is not a 
proposition.

## Step-3

(b)

The statement is a proposition because we know that the statement is false $F$ *(as Tallahassee is the capital of Florida)*.

## Step-4

Let us summarize how the results were derived.

To determine whether a statement is a proposition, we determined whether the 
statement was true or false.

  - If we were able to derive a truth value, then the statement has to be a proposition.
  - If we were unable to assign a truth value to the statement or the truth value was dependent on some variable, then the statement couldn't be a proposition.

## Results

*(b) Proposition, $F$*

###### Exercise 1c
:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Step-1

In this exercise, we determine whether the given statement represents a proposition.

**What is a proposition?**

## Step-2

A **proposition** is a statement that is known to be true or known to be false. 
If we don't know if a statement is true or false, then the statement is not 
a proposition.

## Step-3

**(c)**

The statement is a proposition because we know that the statement is true 
$T$ *(since 2 added to 3 is equal to 5)*.

## Step-4

Let us summarize how the results were derived.

To determine whether a statement is a proposition, we determined whether the 
statement was true or false.

  - If we were able to derive a truth value, then the statement has to be a proposition.
  - If we were unable to assign a truth value to the statement or the truth value was dependent on some variable, then the statement couldn't be a proposition.

## Results

*(c) Proposition, $T$*

###### Exercise 1d
:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Step-1

In this exercise, we determine whether the given statement represents a proposition.

**What is a proposition?**

## Step-2

A **proposition** is a statement that is known to be true or known to be false. 
If we don't know if a statement is true or false, then the statement is not 
a proposition.

## Step-3

**(d)**

The statement is a proposition because we know that the statement is false $F$ 
*(since 5 added to 7 is equal to 12, and thus not equal to 10)*.

## Step-4

Let us summarize how the results were derived.

To determine whether a statement is a proposition, we determined whether the 
statement was true or false.

  - If we were able to derive a truth value, then the statement has to be a proposition.
  - If we were unable to assign a truth value to the statement or the truth value was dependent on some variable, then the statement couldn't be a proposition.

## Results

*(d) Proposition, $F$*

###### Exercise 1e 
:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Step-1

In this exercise, we determine whether the given statement represents a proposition.

**What is a proposition?**

## Step-2

A **proposition** is a statement that is known to be true or known to be false. 
If we don't know if a statement is true or false, then the statement is not 
a proposition.

## Step-3

**(e)**

The statement is not a proposition, because the statement could be true or could be **false** *(but we do not know which case since $x$ is unknown)*.

## Step-4

Let us summarize how the results were derived.

To determine whether a statement is a proposition, we determined whether the 
statement was true or false.

  - If we were able to derive a truth value, then the statement has to be a proposition.
  - If we were unable to assign a truth value to the statement or the truth value was dependent on some variable, then the statement couldn't be a proposition.

## Results

*(e) Not a proposition*

###### Exercise 1f
:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Step-1

In this exercise, we determine whether the given statement represents a proposition.

**What is a proposition?**

## Step-2

A **proposition** is a statement that is known to be true or known to be false. If we don't know if a statement is true or false, then the statement is not a proposition.

## Step-3

**(f)**

The statement is not a proposition, because it is not a statement that could be true or false.

## Step-4

Let us summarize how the results were derived.

To determine whether a statement is a proposition, we determined whether the statement was true or false.

  - If we were able to derive a truth value, then the statement has to be a proposition.
  - If we were unable to assign a truth value to the statement or the truth value was dependent on some variable, then the statement couldn't be a proposition.
