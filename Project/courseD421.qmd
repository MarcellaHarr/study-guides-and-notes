###### Exercise 1a
:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Step-1

The goal of this exercise is to list all elements of the set

::: {.text-center}
$\{x∣x \text{ is a real number such that } x^2=1\}$
:::

**What is a set?**

## Step-2

A **set** is an unordered collection of objects that satisfy a certain 
property. This property can be expressed mathematically or in a form of a sentence.

## Step-3

Let's identify all real numbers $x$ for which $x^2=1$.

::: {.text-center}
$x^2 = 1 ⟹ x = ± 1 ⟹ x = ± 1$
:::

Therefore, elements of the given set are $−1$ and $1$. We can also write this as

::: {.text-center}
$\{x∣x \text{ is a real number such that } x^2=1\} = \{-1, 1\}$.
:::

## Step-4

Let's recap what we have done.

We determined that the real numbers whose square is equal to $1$ are $−1$ and $1$, 
and that they are the only elements of this set.

## Results

::: {.text-center}
$−1,1$

###### Exercise 1b
:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Step-1

The goal of this exercise is to list all elements of the set

::: {.text-center}
$\{x∣ x \text{ is a positive integer less than } 12\}$
:::

**What is a set?**

## Step-2

A **set** is an unordered collection of objects that satisfy a certain 
property. This property can be expressed mathematically or in a form of a sentence.

## Step-3

Remember that positive integers are whole positive numbers, also called natural 
numbers. This set consists of numbers $1,2,3,….$ Therefore, integers that are 
less than $12$ are

::: {.text-center}
$1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11$
:::

These are the elements of our set, which we can also denote as

::: {.text-center}
$\{x∣ x \text{ is a positive integer less than } 12\} = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11\}$
:::

## Step-4

Let's recap what we have done. We recalled what the set of positive integers is, 
and then identified the ones that are less than $12$. These are the whole 
numbers from $1$ to $11$, and they are the only elements of our set.

## Results

::: {.text-center}
$1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11$
:::

###### Exercise 1c
:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Step-1

The goal of this exercise is to list all elements of the set

**What is a set?**

## Step-2

A **set** is an unordered collection of objects that satisfy a certain property. 
This property can be expressed mathematically or in a form of a sentence.

## Step-3

In part $b)\,$ we recalled that integers are whole numbers. Their squares are positive 
whole numbers, or natural numbers. Suppose that a is an integer such that

::: {.text-center}
$a^2=x$
:::

Since $10^2=100$, and we know that $x<100$, it follows that

::: {.text-center}
$a^2 < 10^2 ⟹ \sqrt{a^2} > \sqrt{10^2} ⟹ |a| < |10| ⟹ |a| < 10$
:::

Therefore, $a$ is an integer whose absolute value is smaller than $10$. The list 
of possible values of a is

::: {.text-center}
$0,\thinspace±1,\thinspace±2,\thinspace±3,\thinspace±4,\thinspace±5,\thinspace±6,\thinspace±7,\thinspace±8,\thinspace±9$
:::

Consequently, the list of all possible values of x, which is the square of a is

::: {text-center}
$0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81$
:::

Hence, there are $10$ elements of our set.


## Step-4

Let's recap what we have done.

First, we identified that the absolute value of an integer whose square is less 
than $100$ is smaller than $10$. Then, we listed them and found their squares, 
which are the elements of our set.

## Results

::: {text-center}
$0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81$
