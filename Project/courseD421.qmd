A [**set**]{.mark .vocab} is a collection of objects. The objects in a set are 
called [**elements**]{.mark .vocab}. The [**roster notation**]{.mark .vocab} definition 
of a set is a list of the elements enclosed in curly braces with the individual 
elements separated by commas. 

<br>

###### 1.2.1

{{< video https://youtu.be/nXAOZo_gMaQ aspect-ratio="21x9" >}}

The set with no elements is called the [**empty set**]{.mark .vocab} and is denoted by the 
symbol $∅$. The empty set is sometimes referred to as the [**null set**]{.mark .vocab} and can 
also be denoted by $\{ \}$. [It is also an element of every power set.]{.mark .vocab} 
A [**finite set**]{.mark .vocab} has a finite number of elements. An [**infinite set**]{.mark .vocab} has 
an infinite number of elements.

**element** $\epsilon$ **set**
:::

$x\enspace \epsilon \enspace \{w,x\}$

$p\enspace \epsilon \enspace \{q,r,s\}$

## Subset Example

::: {.text-center}
**set** $\subseteq$ **set**
:::

$\{6,7,8\}\enspace \subseteq \enspace \{1,2,3,...\}$

$\{2\}\enspace \subseteq \enspace \{1,2\}$

<!-- end of panel tabset  -->
:::

The [**cardinality**]{.mark .vocab} of a finite set is the number of elements in that set, and 
is denoted as $|\thinspace|$. Two sets are equal if they have exactly the same 
elements.

:::

A number x is [**positive**]{.mark .vocab} if $x > 0$. A number x is [**negative**]{.mark .vocab} if $x < 0$. The 
number $0$ is neither positive nor negative, so $0 \in \mathbb{Z^+}$ and $0 \in \mathbb{Z^-}$,
and a number $x$ is [**non-negative**]{.mark .vocab} if $x ≥ 0$.

In [**set builder notation**]{.mark .vocab}, a set is defined by specifying that the set includes 
all elements in a larger set that also satisfy certain conditions.

::: {.text-center}
$\mathbb{A} = { x \in \mathbb{S} : \mathbb{P}(x) }$

*$\mathbb{S}$ is the larger set from which the elements in $\mathbb{S}$ are taken.*

The [**universal set**]{.mark .vocab} is a set that contains all elements mentioned in a particular 
context, and is denoted by the variable $\cup$. A [**Venn diagram**]{.mark .vocab} visual 
representation of sets using overlapping circles or other closed curves. However,
zyBook's uses rectangles to denote the universal set and oval shapes to denote 
sets within $\cup$.

## Equal Subsets

::: {.text-center}
**set** $\subseteq$ **set**
:::

Equal sets $\{ \}$ can be considered subsets $\subseteq$. Meaning all of a
set's elements must be found in the other set (superset).

$\mathbb{A}= \{ \mathbb{a, b, c, d, e} \}$

$\mathbb{B}= \{ \mathbb{e, b, c, a, d} \}$

::: {.text-center}
$\mathbb{B} \subseteq \mathbb{A}$
:::

## Proper Subsets

::: {.text-center}
**set** $\subset$ **set**
:::

With [**proper subsets**]{.mark .vocab} $\subset$, equality is not possible. Meaning, 
a set that is a subset $\subseteq$ with lesser elements than the superset is 
considered a proper subset. 

$\mathbb{A}= \{ \mathbb{a, b, c, d, e} \}$

$\mathbb{B}= \{ \mathbb{e, b, c, a, d} \}$

$\mathbb{C}= \{ \mathbb{e, c, a} \}$

::: {.text-center}
$\mathbb{C} \subset \mathbb{A}$ **or** $\mathbb{C} \subset \mathbb{B}$
:::

<!-- end of panel tabset  -->
:::

A [**subset**]{.mark .vocab} is a set whose elements are all contained within 
another set. If every element, for example, in set $\mathbb{A}$ is also an element 
of set $\mathbb{B}$, then $\mathbb{A}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{B}$. It is denoted 
by the symbol: $\mathbb{A} \thinspace \subseteq \mathbb{B}$.

A [**proper subset**]{.mark .vocab} is a subset that is strictly contained within another set, 
meaning it does not include all elements of the larger set. If $\mathbb{A} \thinspace \subseteq \mathbb{B}$ 
and $\mathbb{A} \thinspace \ne \thinspace \mathbb{B}$, then $\mathbb{A}$ is a proper subset of $\mathbb{B}$.
It is denoted by the symbol: $\mathbb{A} \thinspace \subset \thinspace \mathbb{B}$.

###### 1.4

{{< video https://youtu.be/WgE5kr0Tj7M aspect-ratio="21x9" >}}

The [**empty set**]{.mark .vocab} $\varnothing$ is not the same as $\{ \varnothing \}$. 
The cardinality of $\{ \varnothing \}$ is one since it contains exactly one element, 
which is the empty set. A set can contain a combination of numbers and sets of numbers 
as in:

::: {.text-center}
$\mathbb{B} = \{ 2, \varnothing, \{1, 2, 3\}, \{1\} \}$
:::

<br>

###### 1.5

{{< video https://youtu.be/0XNSBoqG-1s aspect-ratio="21x9" >}}

A [**power set**]{.mark .vocab} is a set of all the [subsets]{.underline}, 
including the empty set and the set itself. For example, the power set of a 
set $\mathbb{A}$, denoted $P\{\mathbb{A}\}$, is the set of all subsets 
of $\mathbb{A}$, so, if $\mathbb{A} = \{1,2,3\}$, then:

::: {.text-center}
$P\{\mathbb{A}\} = \{ \varnothing, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{1, 2\}, \{1,3\}, \{2,3\}, \{1, 2, 3\} \}$
:::

::: {.lead}
Cardinality of a power set
: Let $\mathbb{A}$ be a finite set of cardinality $n$. Then the cardinality of the power set of $\mathbb{A}$ is $2^n$, or $\mid P\{\mathbb{A}\}=2^n \mid$.

{{< video https://youtu.be/mOMoZYGirQQ aspect-ratio="21x9" >}}

[**Set intersection**]{.mark .vocab} is the operation that produces a set 
containing only the elements that are common to both sets. If $A$ and $B$ 
are sets, their intersection is the set of all elements that are members of both $\mathbb{A}$ 
[**and**]{.mark .vocab} $\mathbb{B}$. It is denoted by the symbol: $\mathbb{A} \cap \mathbb{B}$

<br>

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Formula

::: {.lead .text-center}
$\mathbb{A} \cap \mathbb{B} = \{ x \thinspace \epsilon \thinspace \mathbb{A} \enspace\text{and}\enspace x \thinspace \epsilon \thinspace \mathbb{B} \}$
:::

This is the formula for the set intersection.

## Example

::: {.lead}
IF
:::

::: {.lead .text-center}
$\mathbb{A} = \{ 1,3,5 \}$;<br>
$\mathbb{B} = \{ 3,4,5 \}$;
:::

::: {.lead}
THEN
:::

::: {.lead .text-center}
$\mathbb{A} \cap \mathbb{B} = \{ 3,5 \}$;
:::

## Note

The union and intersection operations are commutative. That is,

:::{.lead .text-center}
$\mathbb{A} \cap \mathbb{B} = \mathbb{B} \cap \mathbb{A}$

{{< video https://youtu.be/kPcDNNB3U4g aspect-ratio="21x9" >}}

[**Set union**]{.mark .vocab} is the operation that produces a set containing 
all elements that belong to either of two sets. If $A$ and $B$ are sets, their 
union is the set of all elements that are in $\mathbb{A}$, [**or**]{.mark .vocab} 
$\mathbb{B}$, [**or**]{.mark .vocab} in both. It is denoted by the 
symbol: $\mathbb{A} \cup \mathbb{B}$.

<br>

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Formula

::: {.lead .text-center}
$\mathbb{A} \cup \mathbb{B} = \{ x \thinspace \epsilon \thinspace \mathbb{A} \enspace\text{or}\enspace x \thinspace \epsilon \thinspace \mathbb{B} \}$
:::

This is the formula for the set union.

## Example

::: {.lead}
IF
:::

::: {.text-center}
$\mathbb{A} = \{ 1,3,5 \}$;<br>
$\mathbb{B} = \{ 3,4,5 \}$;
:::

::: {.lead}
THEN
:::

::: {.lead .text-center}
$\mathbb{A} \cup \mathbb{B} = \{ 1,3,4,5 \}$;
:::

## Note

The union and intersection operations are commutative. That is,

:::{.lead .text-center}
$\mathbb{A} \cup \mathbb{B} = \mathbb{B} \cup \mathbb{A}$

###### Exercise 1a
:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Step-1

The goal of this exercise is to list all elements of the set

::: {.text-center}
$\{x∣x \text{ is a real number such that } x^2=1\}$
:::

**What is a set?**

## Step-2

A **set** is an unordered collection of objects that satisfy a certain 
property. This property can be expressed mathematically or in a form of a sentence.

## Step-3

Let's identify all real numbers $x$ for which $x^2=1$.

::: {.text-center}
$x^2 = 1 ⟹ x = ± 1 ⟹ x = ± 1$
:::

Therefore, elements of the given set are $−1$ and $1$. We can also write this as

::: {.text-center}
$\{x∣x \text{ is a real number such that } x^2=1\} = \{-1, 1\}$.
:::

## Step-4

Let's recap what we have done.

We determined that the real numbers whose square is equal to $1$ are $−1$ and $1$, 
and that they are the only elements of this set.

## Results

::: {.text-center}
$−1,1$

###### Exercise 1b
:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Step-1

The goal of this exercise is to list all elements of the set

::: {.text-center}
$\{x∣ x \text{ is a positive integer less than } 12\}$
:::

**What is a set?**

## Step-2

A **set** is an unordered collection of objects that satisfy a certain 
property. This property can be expressed mathematically or in a form of a sentence.

## Step-3

Remember that positive integers are whole positive numbers, also called natural 
numbers. This set consists of numbers $1,2,3,….$ Therefore, integers that are 
less than $12$ are

::: {.text-center}
$1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11$
:::

These are the elements of our set, which we can also denote as

::: {.text-center}
$\{x∣ x \text{ is a positive integer less than } 12\} = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11\}$
:::

## Step-4

Let's recap what we have done. We recalled what the set of positive integers is, 
and then identified the ones that are less than $12$. These are the whole 
numbers from $1$ to $11$, and they are the only elements of our set.

## Results

::: {.text-center}
$1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11$
:::

<!-- end panel tabset -->

###### Exercise 1c
:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Step-1

The goal of this exercise is to list all elements of the set

**What is a set?**

## Step-2

A **set** is an unordered collection of objects that satisfy a certain property. 
This property can be expressed mathematically or in a form of a sentence.

## Step-3

In part $b)\,$ we recalled that integers are whole numbers. Their squares are positive 
whole numbers, or natural numbers. Suppose that a is an integer such that

::: {.text-center}
$a^2=x$
:::

Since $10^2=100$, and we know that $x<100$, it follows that

::: {.text-center}
$a^2 < 10^2 ⟹ \sqrt{a^2} > \sqrt{10^2} ⟹ |a| < |10| ⟹ |a| < 10$
:::

Therefore, $a$ is an integer whose absolute value is smaller than $10$. The list 
of possible values of a is

::: {.text-center}
$0,\thinspace±1,\thinspace±2,\thinspace±3,\thinspace±4,\thinspace±5,\thinspace±6,\thinspace±7,\thinspace±8,\thinspace±9$
:::

Consequently, the list of all possible values of x, which is the square of a is

::: {text-center}
$0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81$
:::

Hence, there are $10$ elements of our set.


## Step-4

Let's recap what we have done.

First, we identified that the absolute value of an integer whose square is less 
than $100$ is smaller than $10$. Then, we listed them and found their squares, 
which are the elements of our set.

## Results

::: {text-center}
$0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81$
