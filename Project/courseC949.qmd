### Characteristics of Algorithms

**Finiteness**

An algorithm must always have a finite number of steps before it ends. When the 
operation is finished, it must have a defined endpoint or output and not enter 
an endless loop.

**Definiteness**

An algorithm needs to have exact definitions for each step. Clear and 
straightforward directions ensure that every step is understood and can be 
taken easily.

**Input**

An algorithm requires one or more inputs. The values that are first supplied to 
the algorithm before its processing are known as inputs. These inputs come from 
a predetermined range of acceptable values.

**Output**

One or more outputs must be produced by an algorithm. The output is the outcome 
of the algorithm after every step has been completed. The relationship between 
the input and the result should be clear.

**Effectiveness**

An algorithm's stages must be sufficiently straightforward to be carried out in 
a finite time utilizing fundamental operations. With the resources at hand, 
every operation in the algorithm should be doable and practicable.

**Generality**

Rather than being limited to a single particular case, an algorithm should be 
able to solve a group of issues. It should offer a generic fix that manages a 
variety of inputs inside a predetermined range or domain.

What is Lorem Ipsum?

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
